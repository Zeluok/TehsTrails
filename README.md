### Map Completion 
A pack tailored for speedrunning map completion. It utilizes all mounts, waypoints and a multitude of markers (Over 5,000!) to give you the fastest map completion times possible. The current Core Tyria map comp world record of 8h59m utilizes this packs routing!

### Lanterns 
With EoD we got a new way to do repeatable map comp -- Jade Lanterns. As these are very promising for their speed, and no longer require us to create more and more characters, they may very well be the new map comp. As such, I'm in the process of creating routing for each of the 4 Cantha maps lanterns as well. The goal here is just the same as map comp -- get it all as fast as possible.

### Hero Point Trails
*Warning! This pack is still very rough, I haven't had a chance to give it much attention since I created it over two years ago.*

A collection of trails for the routes I used to use for my Hero Point Trains in HoT and PoF maps. Path of Fire can easily be used to quickly get an elite spec solo (~1-2 hours). It's recommend to bring some friends if you intend to do the Heart of Thorns HP's, as some can be difficult to solo.
